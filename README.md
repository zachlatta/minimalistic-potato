The Story
---------

Minimalistic Potato tells the heartbreaking story of Spudnik, a lost potato. Spudnik is stuck in a dystopia of white.
An insipid plain of nothing. A place that lacks color, emotion, and all that is interesting. But when it seems like all
is lost, an external force (your finger/mouse) flings across the void! It takes a second, but he slowly follows your
finger with curiosity. Pixel after pixel. Movement after movement. And when Spudnik reaches where the external force
stopped, he freezes in fear, lost. But with that fear comes the tiniest sliver of hope. Hope that there is something
out there better than this. That there is a world filled with color, with hope, and with triumph. But for now he is
stuck in this dystopia. And only you can guide him. Only you can teach him to potate.

The project is set up with Maven, which will make getting started super easy. Just clone the repository to get started!

    git clone https://github.com/zachlatta/minimalistic-potato

Once you have it cloned, you can run the `-Pdesktop package` target to compile and package the game for desktops. If you
want to compile and package it for Android, just run `-Pandroid package`. Just make sure you have your `ANDROID_HOME`
environment variable set to the path to your Android SDK. Also, you'll want at least Android SDK version 17 downloaded.

HTML exporting is still in the works.
