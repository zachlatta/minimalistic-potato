I like to think of Minimalistic Potato as a reflection on the ephemerality of the human condition. Interpret it how you wish though. Potatoes gonna potate.\r\n\r\n![Spudnik](http://i.imgur.com/yx7BV8F.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n-----\r\n[Submission page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=18900)\r\n\r\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zachlatta.minimalistic_potato.android)\r\n\r\n[Continous Integration](http://ci.zachlatta.com/job/minimalistic-potato/)\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPotatoes gonna potate. Help me make Spudnik potate harder than the rest.\r\n\r\n![Potatoes Gonna Potate](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/233892/18900-shot0.png)\r\n\r\nThe project is set up with Maven, which will make getting started super easy. Just clone the repository to get started!\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/zachlatta/minimalistic-potato\r\n\r\n### Desktop\r\n\r\nRun the `-Pdesktop package` goal to compile and package the game for desktops.\r\n\r\n    mvn -Pdesktop package\r\n\r\nIt will create a file called `minimalistic-potato-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` in the `desktop/target` folder. It contains all of the necessary dependencies, the assets, and a manifest file specifying the main class. You can run this file via:\r\n\r\n    java -jar minimalistic-potato-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar\r\n    \r\n\r\n### Android\r\n\r\nTo create an unsigned APK for Android run the `-Pandroid package` goal.\r\n\r\n    mvn -Pandroid package\r\n\r\nThis will create a file called minimalistic-potato-android-1.0-SNAPSHOT.apk in the `android/target` folder. To install the APK to a connected device or emulator, run the `-Pandroid install` goal.\r\n\r\n    mvn -Pandroid install\r\n\r\n\r\n### HTML5\r\n\r\nTo compile the project to HTML5, run the `-Phtml package` goal.\r\n\r\n    mvn -Phtml package\r\n\r\nThe end result is located in the `html/target` folder. You can either use the `.war` file that was generated and deploy that to Jetty/Tomcat, or copy the contents of the `html/target/minimalistic-potato-html-1.0-SNAPSHOT` folder to a location on a web server. After you have the files on the web server, copy the generated `assets` folder (in root of project) to the folder you copied onto the web server. Watch out, if you just try to open `MinimalisticPotato.html` with a web browser on your computer, you're going to get a Javascript error (at least on Chrome).\r\n","google":"UA-34529482-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
