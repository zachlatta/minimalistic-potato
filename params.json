Spudnik is stuck in a dystopia of white.\r\nAn insipid plain of nothing. A place that lacks color, emotion, and all that is interesting. But when it seems like all\r\nis lost, an external force (your finger/mouse) flings across the void! It takes a second, but he slowly follows your\r\nfinger with curiosity. Pixel after pixel. Movement after movement. And when Spudnik reaches where the external force\r\nstopped, he freezes in fear, lost. But with that fear comes the tiniest sliver of hope. Hope that there is something\r\nout there better than this. That there is a world filled with color, with hope, and with triumph. But for now he is\r\nstuck in this dystopia. And only you can guide him. Only you can teach him to potate.\r\n\r\n![Spudnik](http://i.imgur.com/yx7BV8F.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n-----\r\n[Submission page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=18900)\r\n\r\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zachlatta.minimalistic_potato.android)\r\n\r\n[Continous Integration](http://ci.zachlatta.com/job/minimalistic-potato/)\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPotatoes gonna potate.

Just clone the repository to get started!\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/zachlatta/minimalistic-potato\r\n\r\nOnce you have it cloned, you can run the `-Pdesktop package` target to compile and package the game for desktops. If you\r\nwant to compile and package it for Android, just run `-Pandroid package`. Just make sure you have your `ANDROID_HOME`\r\nenvironment variable set to the path to your Android SDK. Also, you'll want at least Android SDK version 17 downloaded.\r\n\r\nHTML exporting is still in the works.\r\n","google":"UA-34529482-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
