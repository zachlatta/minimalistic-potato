Spudnik is stuck in a dystopia of white.\r\nAn insipid plain of nothing. A place that lacks color, emotion, and all that is interesting. But when it seems like all\r\nis lost, an external force (your finger/mouse) flings across the void! It takes a second, but he slowly follows your\r\nfinger with curiosity. Pixel after pixel. Movement after movement. And when Spudnik reaches where the external force\r\nstopped, he freezes in fear, lost. But with that fear comes the tiniest sliver of hope. Hope that there is something\r\nout there better than this. That there is a world filled with color, with hope, and with triumph. But for now he is\r\nstuck in this dystopia. And only you can guide him. Only you can teach him to potate.\r\n\r\n![Spudnik](http://i.imgur.com/yx7BV8F.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n-----\r\n[Submission page](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=18900)\r\n\r\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zachlatta.minimalistic_potato.android)\r\n\r\n[Continous Integration](http://ci.zachlatta.com/job/minimalistic-potato/)\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPotatoes gonna potate.

Just clone the repository to get started!\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/zachlatta/minimalistic-potato\r\n\r\n### Desktop\r\n\r\nRun the `-Pdesktop package` goal to compile and package the game for desktops.\r\n\r\n    mvn -Pdesktop package\r\n\r\nIt will create a file called `minimalistic-potato-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` in the `desktop/target` folder.\r\nIt contains all of the necessary dependencies, the assets, and a manifest file specifying the main class. You can run\r\nthis file via:\r\n\r\n    java -jar minimalistic-potato-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar\r\n    \r\n\r\n### Android\r\n\r\nTo create an unsigned APK for Android run the `-Pandroid package` goal.\r\n\r\n    mvn -Pandroid package\r\n\r\nThis will create a file called minimalistic-potato-android-1.0-SNAPSHOT.apk in the `android/target` folder. To install\r\nthe APK to a connected device or emulator, run the `-Pandroid install` goal.\r\n\r\n    mvn -Pandroid install\r\n\r\n\r\n### HTML5\r\n\r\nTo compile the project to HTML5, run the `-Phtml package` goal.\r\n\r\n    mvn -Phtml package\r\n\r\nThe end result is located in the `html/target` folder. You can either use the `.war` file that was generated and deploy\r\nthat to Jetty/Tomcat, or copy the contents of the `html/target/minimalistic-potato-html-1.0-SNAPSHOT` folder to a\r\nlocation on a web server. Watch out, if just try to open `MinimalisticPotato.html` with a web browser on your computer,\r\nyou're going to get a Javascript error (at least on Chrome).\r\n","google":"UA-34529482-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
